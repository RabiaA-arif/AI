# Credit Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning

 # Goal
  machine learning that predict the risk lavel of credit
  good -> low risk ->suppose 1
  bad -> high risk -> suppose 0


  # Project overview 
   in this project i used german credit risk dataset and developed a prediction     model that can predict whether borrower is repay or not based on their financial and some features the solution include data cleaning ,feature encoding,model  
training,evalutation,deployment via streamlit 

# Key Technologies

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost,DecisionTreeClassifier ,RandomForecast,ExtraTreeClassifier Streamlit, joblib
